## SarahP.Studio portfolio site

SarahP.Studio is an overview of the projects that I create, play, and explore with as a developer and an artist. This site was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/).

It features a user login and a portfolio database in Firebase, connected to React.
